# UNet-Autoencoder
U-Net is a convolutional neural network that was developed for biomedical image segmentation at the Computer Science Department of the University of Freiburg, Germany. The network is based on the fully convolutional network[2] and its architecture was modified and extended to work with fewer training images and to yield more precise segmentations
